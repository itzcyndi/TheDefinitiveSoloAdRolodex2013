Solo ads do work, but the conversions are often lower than free traffic sources if 
people watch one of your videos first of read one of your blog posts. 

But solo ads work, and you need to have a highly profitable sales funnel in place first
for them to work. This is all taught to you in this product "The Definitive Solo Ad
Rolodex 2013"

The best solo ads training resource (complete with lead capture page templates, webiniars
plugins, you name it) is The Definitive Solo Ad Rolodex 2013 .

Let me give you some tips on conversions:

* Consistency - Most people get discouraged with solo ads because they get emotionally
attached to their money and think it "does not work" if they do not make a huge profit.
But if you can just make back your spend and break even then you are doing very well indeed. 

The way to see results with solo ads is to place them on a daily basis.

And to keep up this consistency you need to not get emotional over your money. Set aside
a percentage of your earnings and put them back into solo ads. This is money that in your
mind does not exist so it does not matter if you don't make it all back.

* Watch out for the Freebie Seekers -  When it comes to doing solo ads lists there are
a lot of freebie seekers that get passed from list to list on a daily basis. 
These people may just like the free gifts and not want
to buy anything. They are also being hammered with emails from multiple marketers daily so
it is hard to get through. So you just need to be aware that you need to sift through 
hundreds and hundreds of these leads to find the people that actually buy stuff.

* Sales Funnel - Solo Ads work, but make sure you have a strong sales funnel.
This is all taught to you in this product The Definitive Solo Ad Rolodex 2013.
